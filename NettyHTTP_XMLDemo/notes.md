#Netty HTTP+XML Protocol Stack Development

Communications among systems with different architecture usually adapts HTTP protocol, the very popular examples are `HTTP+XML` or `RESTful+JSON`.

Heavy Web containers like `Tomcat` usually have complicated functions, and many safety bugs as well. So it's getting much more difficult to develop and maintain your project using that for you have to fix the bugs by your own. A more lighter HTTP protocol stack is a better choice for such occasion.
